 	 I am a born and raised American from Houston, Texas. I am currently in my first year at ESSEC Business School earning a Bachelors in Global Business Administration. I am the youngest out of 3 children in my family and am the first to study french and study abroad in my family. Growing up I loved to go to the beach, travel and visit new restaurants with my family. Currently my passions have decreased in the level of interest. I now love to watch TV, hang out with friends and travel. My favorite activity out of these is traveling. Click the link below to discover my Instagram which provides a few pictures from my experiences abroad.

		<h2>Watching TV</h2>
<p>  My favorite streaming services are Netflix and Disney + because they relaxe me and also entertain me. My favorite shows are Kaleidescope, Brooklyn 99 and Friends on Netflix. On Disney+, my favorite movies are How To Train a Dragon and The Princess and The Frog  </p>
